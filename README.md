## Brand Story

Alor Feri is a promising Bangladeshi technology startup founded in 2021. The company's mission is to empower libraries and connect readers with books and knowledge to improve the quality of education and enlighten society. The company's name means "light and ferry" in Bengali, symbolizing the idea of bringing light and guidance to people through technology. Alor Feri's core values are innovation, collaboration, and social impact.

## Logo Guidelines

The alor feri logo consists of two elements: the wordmark and the icon. The wordmark is written in lowercase letters using the Montserrat font, with a yellow dot above the letter "i". The icon is a stylized representation of a book and a ferry, using green and yellow colors. The logo represents the company's vision of providing access to books and knowledge through technology.

The logo should always be used in its original form and colors, without any modifications or alterations. The logo should also have enough clear space around it, and should not be placed on busy or contrasting backgrounds. The logo should always be legible and recognizable, and should not be smaller than 25 pixels in height.

The logo has two versions: the horizontal version and the vertical version. The horizontal version should be used whenever possible, as it is the preferred and most recognizable version. The vertical version should only be used when there is limited horizontal space available, or when it is more suitable for the layout or design.
